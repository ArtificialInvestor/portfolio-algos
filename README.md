##All Weather V1

> We aim to show here that very basic quantitatively driven strategies that generate returns from different market behaviours when combined can provide a more desirable and reliable return streams that can be leveraged to generate a superior return to the market, although we must be clear that this is not the objective.
> We compare different strategies alone vs when combined in any particular combination is somewhat inferior to the quality of returns stream generated when all are combined together.
