##All Weather V1

> We aim to show here that very basic quantitatively driven strategies that generate returns from different market behaviours when combined can provide a more desirable and reliable return streamS that can be leveraged to generate a superior return to the market, although we must be clear that this is not the objective.
> Below we compare the different strategies alone vs when combined in any particular combination is somewhat inferior to the quality of returns stream generated when all are combined together.

__Covered in notebooks:__
* Introduction, ideas, setup
* Backesting Optimised Strategies with review of performance
* Combining Optimised Strategies with review of performance
* Review of Results, comparing strongest combinations of strategies
